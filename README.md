Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Defence

## Idea

Create a smart, AI-powered interview platform that simulates a real boardroom experience. It will ask relevant questions based on the applicantâ€™s field, evaluate their responses, and score both questions and answers for relevance and quality. This helps in objectively selecting the best candidate.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
User Interface (UI): For candidate and panel interaction (web or app-based).

AI Interview Engine:

Generates ice-breaker and domain-specific questions.

Understands candidate profile and tailors questions accordingly.

Response Analyzer:

Uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to evaluate candidate answers.

Scores relevance, clarity, and accuracy.

Expert Feedback Module:

Allows experts to rate both questions and answers.

AI uses this feedback to learn and improve.

Scoring and Reporting System:

Combines scores from AI and experts.

Provides a final report on candidate performance.

## Use Cases
Candidate Interview Simulation:
Candidates experience a realistic panel interview and receive feedback.

Expert Interview Assistance:
Experts get relevant question suggestions and AI-supported evaluations.

Scoring and Ranking System:
Automates the grading of interviews to ensure fairness and consistency.

Training Tool:
Can be used to train new interviewers on how to conduct objective assessments.
